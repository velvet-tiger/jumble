### Added
- New `reload_workspace` MCP tool to reload `.jumble` workspace and project metadata from disk without restarting the server.

### Changed
- Workspace and project discovery is now performed once at startup and cached in memory, rather than rescanning the filesystem on every tools call.
- Updated README to describe the cached behavior and the `reload_workspace` tool.

## [0.2.0]

- Initial public release of `jumble` as an MCP server for workspace-aware project context.
